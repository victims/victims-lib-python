        What the heck is mnfy for?
        --------------------------
        
        The mnfy project was created for two reasons:
        
        * To show that shipping bytecode files without source, as a form of obfuscation,
          is not the best option available
        * Provide a minification of Python source code when total byte size of source
          code is paramount
        
        When people ship Python code as only bytecode files (i.e. only ``.pyo`` files
        and no ``.py`` files), there are couple drawbacks. First and foremost, it
        prevents users from using your code with all available Python interpreters such
        as Jython_ and IronPython_. Another drawback is that it is a poor form of
        obfuscation as projects like Meta_ allow you to take bytecode and
        reverse-engineer the original source code as enough details are kept that the
        only details missing are single-line comments.
        
        When the total number of bytes used to ship Python code is paramount, then
        you want to minify the source code. Bytecode files actually contain so much
        detail that the space savings can be miniscule (e.g. the ``decimal`` module from
        Python's standard libary, which is the largest single file in the stdlib, has a
        bytecode file that is only 5% smaller than its source code compared to 30%
        smaller with just `source emission`_ minification).
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        A note about version numbers and Python version compatibility
        -------------------------------------------------------------
        
        The version number for mnfy is `PEP 386`_ compliant, taking the form of
        ``PPP.FFF.BBB``. The ``FFF.BBB`` represents the feature and bugfix version
        numbers of mnfy itself. The ``PPP`` portion of the version number represents the
        Python version that mnfy is compatible with:
        ``'{}{}'.format(*sys.version_info[:2])``.
        
        The Python version that mnfy is compatible with is directly embedded in the version
        number as Python's AST is not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible. This means
        that you should use each version of mnfy with specific version of Python.
        Since mnfy works with source code and not bytecode you can safely use
        mnfy on code that must be backwards-compatible with older versions of Python,
        just make sure the interpreter you use with mnfy is correct and can parse the
        source code (e.g. just because
        the latest version of mnfy only works with Python 3.3 does not mean you cannot
        use that release against source code that must work with Python 3.2, just make
        sure to use a Python 3.3 interpreter with mnfy and that the source code can be
        read by a Python 3.3 interpreter).
        
        Command-line Usage
        ------------------
        
        **TL;DR**: pass the file you want to minify as an argument to mnfy and it will
        print to stdout the source code minifited such that the AST is **exactly** the
        same as the original source code. To get transformations that change the AST
        to varying degrees, use some flags.
        
        See the help message for the project for full instructions on usage::
        
          python3 -m mnfy -h
          python3 mnfy.py -h
